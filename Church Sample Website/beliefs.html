                <h1>Mount Olive Beliefs</h1>
                <p>Mount Olive Baptist Church in full agreement and compliance with the 2000 Baptist Faith and Message <a href="http://www.sbc.net/bfm2000/bfm2000.asp">2000 BF&M</a>  This is not a creedal statement or list of rules but rather a document that binds us together as Southern Baptists.  Listed below are a few of the highlights of what we believe</p>

				<p><em>The Bible</em><br>Please check out the Bible link for a full explanation</p>
				
				<p><em>The Trinity</em><br>We believe in the Triune God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.  He is One God, yet three Persons.  Although the word Trinity never appears in Scripture, we see a beautiful picture of it at Jesusâ€™ Baptism.  Matthew 3:16-17</p>

				<p><em>Mankind, the Fall and Salvation</em><br>We have been created in the image of God in order to glorify Him and have fellowship with Him.  When Adam and Eve sinned, that fellowship was broken.  As a result, man is imperfect and completely unable to save himself.  The sinfulness of man made it necessary for God to send His Son Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, to serve as a substitute.  When Jesus died on the cross, He paid the full penalty for sin.  He bore the full wrath of God on our behalf so that we could be saved and He has made the gift available to anyone who truly believes.</p> 

				<p><em>The Church</em><br>We believe that the church exists to bring honor and glory to God by serving Jesus Christ and carrying out the Great Commission found in the Gospels.</p>
