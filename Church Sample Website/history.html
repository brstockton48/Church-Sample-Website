                <h1>Mount Olive History</h1>
                <p>Below you will find a brief history of our church. The history of an organization often incudes the names of people who made significant contributions.  The absence of those names and even pastors is not to diminish their importance but rather to emphasize that the history of this church has been accomplished through the providence of God</p>
                
                <h3>Early Years</h3>
                
                <p>Mount Olive Baptist Church has a rich history that dates all the way back to 1873.  The Civil War left a wake of devastation but the original members were committed to their faith.  They met outside under the trees and the membership consisted mostly of widows, orphans and Civil War veterans and their families.  It wasnâ€™t until sometime in 1874 that land was donated and a building for worship was constructed.  The church did very well in its first 60 years of existence and saw a great number of people touched, encouraged and changed by the Gospel.  Despite early success, however, the church went through some rough years in the late 1920s and ultimately had to close its doors in 1933.</p>

                <h3>1940 - 1990</h3>

                <p>Fortunately the church lived to see another day.  On September 29th, 1940 they re-opened with a renewed sense of vigor and saw substantial growth in the first few years.  The years between 1940 and 1990 were marked by forward progress that could be visibly seen by six different building projects and renovations.</p>

                <h3>Recent History</h3>

                <p>Since 1990, the area surrounding the church has been marked by a decline in population and younger families have migrated to Yemassee and other areas of Hampton County.  Nonetheless, Mount Olive Baptist Church continues to seek ways to reach every successive generation.</p>
