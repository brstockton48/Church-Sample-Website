                <h1>The Bible</h1>
                
                <p>At Mount Olive Baptist Church, we hold the Bible in high regard.  We believe that it is inerrant in its original manuscripts.  To us, it is not just a book to lay on our coffee tables, it is an essential part of our everyday lives.  But not only do we center our lives around the Bible, we center our services around it.  Here it is not enough for our messages to simply contain the Bible, we believe they must explain the Bible.</p>
                <p>Because of this firm belief, we seek to preach through the Bible book by book and verse by verse.  The Bible is the only book that will allow us to escape into the Lion's Den or the Flood or the Fiery Furnace while at the same time learning vital truths in which to live our lives.  In addition we find people who should be in despair because they are in prison yet to our surprise they are filed with joy and are seeking to help us find the same joy.  And let us not forget the amazing story of Jesus found in the gospel accounts which is part of the bigger story of the entirety of the Bible.</p>
                <p>Many have asked the question, is the Bible true? Or is it simply a book of made up stories?  And if it is true, does it really matter?  Is it important?  Dr. David Jeremiah who is the pastor of Shadow Mountain Church in El Cajon California  does a great job of talking about the importance of the Bible.  One remarkable truth he reminds us of is that the Bible is still the best selling book of all time and is the best seller every single year.  Please check out the video on the right.  Another great resource to check out is Lee Strobel.  Lee Strobel was an atheist and set out to disprove the Bible but the further he went along, the more he became convinced that it was true.  He recorded his journey in a book called "The Case for Christ".  Here is a link to his website: <a href="https://https://leestrobel.com/">Lee Strobel</a> <br></p>
