                <h1>Mount Olive Baptist Church</h1>
                <h3>At Mount Olive we are just like family</h3>
                
                <p>Thank you so much for visiting our site.  At Mount Olive we understand the importance of loving God and loving others.  It is one thing to say we are like family, but here we put these words into practice.  While it may sound cliche to some, we understand one very important truth and we allow that to be one of our guiding principles.  "People will not care how much we know until they know how much we care".  Mount Olive feels like home because there is a strong sense of community among believers. Please come check us out this Sunday and see firsthand that we are a church who truly loves God and cares for others.</p>
