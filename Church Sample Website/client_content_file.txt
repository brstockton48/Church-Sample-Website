2.  Mount Olive Baptist Church Mission
    
		<h1>Mount Olive Mission</h1>
		<section>
                <h4>Our Mission is to bring glory to God and seek to build His Kingdom through our lives and through our church</h4>
                
                <p>This mission statement may sound like something you have heard before.  We here at Mount Olive fully realize that these words are meaningless unless they are accompanied by action.  But in order to take action, we must first understand what this statement means. Below is a list of tangible things we can do to help carry out this mission.</p>
				<ul>
	           		<p>Go to church every Sunday <br>
	           		Share our story with others <br>
	           		Read our Bibles daily <br>
	           		Pray Daily <br>
	           		Serve in the church <br>
	           		Serve in the community <br>
	           		Give time and resources to oversees and local missions.  Please check out mission videos on the right side of the screen <br>
	           		Give time and resources to local worthy causes (e.g Disaster Relief)</p>
           		</ul>
           		<p>In theory, it is easy to be on mission, but in practice it is not quite as simple.  In other words, these are not just things to be done and checked off a list.  The fact is that we can go through the motion of doing all these things but not carry out the mission because we do it with the wrong motive or wrong attitude.  In other words, the things on this list should be the results of a church or an individual on mission for God.  We believe as a church, our responsibility is to teach the importance of having a mission and providing opportunities to carry out that mission</p>

3.  Mount Olive Baptist Church History
	   <section>
                <h1>Mount Olive History</h1>
                <p>Below you will find a brief history of our church. The history of an organization often incudes the names of people who made significant contributions.  The absence of those names and even pastors is not to diminish their importance but rather to emphasize that the history of this church has been accomplished through the providence of God</p>
                
                <h3>Early Years</h3>
                
                <p>Mount Olive Baptist Church has a rich history that dates all the way back to 1873.  The Civil War left a wake of devastation but the original members were committed to their faith.  They met outside under the trees and the membership consisted mostly of widows, orphans and Civil War veterans and their families.  It wasn’t until sometime in 1874 that land was donated and a building for worship was constructed.  The church did very well in its first 60 years of existence and saw a great number of people touched, encouraged and changed by the Gospel.  Despite early success, however, the church went through some rough years in the late 1920s and ultimately had to close its doors in 1933.</p>

                <h3>1940 - 1990</h3>

                <p>Fortunately the church lived to see another day.  On September 29th, 1940 they re-opened with a renewed sense of vigor and saw substantial growth in the first few years.  The years between 1940 and 1990 were marked by forward progress that could be visibly seen by six different building projects and renovations.</p>

                <h3>Recent History</h3>

                <p>Since 1990, the area surrounding the church has been marked by a decline in population and younger families have migrated to Yemassee and other areas of Hampton County.  Nonetheless, Mount Olive Baptist Church continues to seek ways to reach every successive generation.</p>

4.  Mount Olive Baptist Church Beliefs
   
	   <section>
                <h1>Mount Olive Beliefs</h1>
                <p>Mount Olive Baptist Church in full agreement and compliance with the 2000 Baptist Faith and Message <a href="http://www.sbc.net/bfm2000/bfm2000.asp">2000 BF&M</a>  This is not a creedal statement or list of rules but rather a document that binds us together as Southern Baptists.  Listed below are a few of the highlights of what we believe</p>

				<p><em>The Bible</em><br>Please check out the Bible link for a full explanation</p>
				
				<p><em>The Trinity</em><br>We believe in the Triune God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.  He is One God, yet three Persons.  Although the word Trinity never appears in Scripture, we see a beautiful picture of it at Jesus’ Baptism.  Matthew 3:16-17</p>

				<p><em>Mankind, the Fall and Salvation</em><br>We have been created in the image of God in order to glorify Him and have fellowship with Him.  When Adam and Eve sinned, that fellowship was broken.  As a result, man is imperfect and completely unable to save himself.  The sinfulness of man made it necessary for God to send His Son Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, to serve as a substitute.  When Jesus died on the cross, He paid the full penalty for sin.  He bore the full wrath of God on our behalf so that we could be saved and He has made the gift available to anyone who truly believes.</p> 

				<p><em>The Church</em><br>We believe that the church exists to bring honor and glory to God by serving Jesus Christ and carrying out the Great Commission found in the Gospels.</p>

5. Mount Olive Baptist Church Media Gallery


	    <section>
			<h1>Mount Olive Media Gallery</h1>
            		<p>Welcome to the Mount Olive Baptist Church Media Gallery.  We here at Mount Olive believe the age old saying that a picture is worth 1,000 words.  The same could and should be said about videos.  For that reason, we do our best to incorporate the use of media into our services.  This would include music videos with words so that our congregation can sing along.  In addition, we incorporate the use of Powerpoint and video clips into our messages each and every week. Our reasoning for this is that we believe someone is much more likely to remember and retain information if they have both heard and seen it.  It is often easy to forget the words that are said, it is much more difficult to forget an engaging video</p>
            		<p>While we think the use of media is important and helpful, we also want to be clear that it does not replace the Bible or the importance of joining together as a congregation and singing with the accompaniment of the piano and other instruments.  At our church, we have a great balance and strive to make room for both.</p>
            		<p>Please enjoy our picture slide shows at the top of the page and videos to the right.  Pictures include different members of the congregation, VBS photos, building and grounds and God's wonderful creation.  Please visit often because these photos and videos will be updated on a regular basis.</p>

6. The Bible

	     <section>
                <h1>The Bible</h1>
                
                	<p>At Mount Olive Baptist Church, we hold the Bible in high regard.  We believe that it is inerrant in its original manuscripts.  To us, it is not just a book to lay on our coffee tables, it is an essential part of our everyday lives.  But not only do we center our lives around the Bible, we center our services around it.  Here it is not enough for our messages to simply contain the Bible, we believe they must explain the Bible.</p>
                	<p>Because of this firm belief, we seek to preach through the Bible book by book and verse by verse.  The Bible is the only book that will allow us to escape into the Lion's Den or the Flood or the Fiery Furnace while at the same time learning vital truths in which to live our lives.  In addition we find people who should be in despair because they are in prison yet to our surprise they are filed with joy and are seeking to help us find the same joy.  And let us not forget the amazing story of Jesus found in the gospel accounts which is part of the bigger story of the entirety of the Bible.</p>
                	<p>Many have asked the question, is the Bible true? Or is it simply a book of made up stories?  And if it is true, does it really matter?  Is it important?  Dr. David Jeremiah who is the pastor of Shadow Mountain Church in El Cajon California  does a great job of talking about the importance of the Bible.  One remarkable truth he reminds us of is that the Bible is still the best selling book of all time and is the best seller every single year.  Please check out the video on the right.  Another great resource to check out is Lee Strobel.  Lee Strobel was an atheist and set out to disprove the Bible but the further he went along, the more he became convinced that it was true.  He recorded his journey in a book called "The Case for Christ".  Here is a link to his website: <a href="https://https://leestrobel.com/">Lee Strobel</a> <br></p>
